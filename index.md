Since young I always had a profound interest in sciences and arts.
I started to do my first programming by researching all I could on the nearby
library about digital systems, computers and operating systems.
I wrote my first programs on a ZX Spectrum and 386 MS-DOS computers that I was
alowed into. My first programming languages were BASIC and x86 assembler.

During my secondary education I wanted to build a huge relection telescope with
science funding, my teachers thought it would be impossible so they convinced me
to apply the money in science projects for school. It was great to see all the
class involved in scientific divulgation events.

Later I followed my studies in Arts to later apply in Architecture. I turned to
Computer Science instead but I still like the architecture subject.

I have a curious mind and I'm always learning new things, this way I managed to
learn a lot of programming languages during my life:
- Assemblers z80, 68k, x86, ARM
- C
- C++
- Python
- Ruby
- Erlang
- Scheme/Racket
- Common LISP
- C#
- PHP
- Javascript
- ADA
- Java
- Bash

I'm mostly proeficient computer graphics algorithms.
