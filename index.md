Since young I always had a profound interest in sciences and arts.
I started to do my first programming by researching all I could on the nearby
library about digital systems, computers and operating systems.
I wrote my first programs on a ZX Spectrum and 386 MS-DOS computers that I was
alowed into. My first programming languages were BASIC and x86 assembler.
