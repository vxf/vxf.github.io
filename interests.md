Computer Graphics Algorithms
============================
Since I had my first gaming console, the SEGA MegaDrive, I always had a
fascination about how computer games work from inside out.
Even more, computer graphics is the most obvious way that we can do art
with computers.
This led me to since then explore all about computer graphics algorithms
from the ancient hardware hack to the most advanced GPU algorithms, and
this exploration seems to never end.

Among other things this led to the discovery of the [Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene),
which I've been following since.
It's hackers' subculture spanning from the times of the C64 and Amiga hackers
dedicated mostly to develop the most impressive realtime algorithms in computer graphics.

Arduino
=======
I've always been interested in hardware and low level programming and recently
got into experimenting with arduino platform and other similar electronics.
I like not only to tinker with these inexpensive modules I can find on ebay, 
but also to make them interact with old stuff I find around, like EEPROMS or
keyboards. This gives me a better feeling of freedom to now be restricted to
modules designed for hobbyists. I also like to make attemps at programming in
assembler or direct C, to make use of my skills above the common hobbyist.

Some of the interesting boards I own:
- FleaFPGA Uno Arduino compatible FPGA developed by my friend [Valentin Angelovsky](https://www.fleasystems.com/fleaFPGA.html) ;-)
- NodeMCU ESP12E DEVKIT
- Arduino Nano (my tough buddy which held most of the experiments)
- PCD8544 Nokia LCD, because I love pixels
- A couple of Arduinos, ESP modules, and hardware I scrape around

I try to keep some of these projects at [github vxf/arduino](https://github.com/vxf/arduino),
although this is not my best code, I also like to not use the Arduino libraries
and stick to raw AVR C whenever possible, so I can get a better feel of low
level programming.
