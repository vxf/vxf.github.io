Developer - Locomotiva
======================
Locomotiva is a company specialized in 3D animation but also other design and
web related projects, I had the privilege to work with this talented team.

Imagina project
---------------
Main developer at a challenging project aimed at architecture kiosks and desktops,
to develop a portable 3D presentation of architecture that could handle most
mainstream 3D hardware available at the time (like GeForce4).
This project involved producing high quality models and loading into
the application coded in C++, using [Ogre 3D engine](http://www.ogre3d.org/), handling basic physics with
[ODE engine](http://www.ode.org/).

The big challenge was to achieve good performance and quality like the best 3D
applications at the time, using my 3D programming skills and also learning new
ones, long before the easy 3D engines like Unity even existed.

But most of all it was fun to work with this talentful team of different skillsets
in design, 3D modeling and animation, and programming.

Other projects
--------------
At Locomotiva I was also involved in other projects, like RIA applications in
Adobe Flex Actionscript interacting with PHP, and web development.


Developer - [minecraft.pt](https://www.mcpt.eu/)
================================================
A group of developers, players of Minecraft game, meeting in irc PTnet decided to take
a bit of their time and create a Minecraft server and so this [project was born](https://www.mcpt.eu/).
Soon what started as a game grew up into a more serious project that would become
the biggest portuguese Minecraft community when this game got all the attention.

It would involve 
complex database interactions, Java programming into the game server, inovative
Javascript and WebGl features, Linux system administration with serious 
performance and security issues (Minecraft players seem to be very fond of hacking).
At some times this server supported as much as around 10000 users playing at the same time.

It also involved using serious development methodologies and organization of an
ever growing development team connected across the Internet.
It was a privilege to work from the start of this project with this team of
skilled Computer Engineers, Programmers and Graphic Designers, with which I learned a lot.

Developer - [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/u/vxflores)
===============================================================
For a couple of years I also worked as a freelancer developer at [freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/u/vxflores).
This was an opportunity to put my skillset in practice and also to develop self-organization skills.
Had the chance to meet many clients around the world, made them happy and developed
a solid freelancer profile.

Although I've worked pretty much in any area, mostly I developed for Android,
PHP, Java, Python, Scrapy scraping python framework, Symfony PHP framework, 
Zend PHP framework, Wordpress, Javascript, and so on...

Computer technician - HDDPRO40
==============================
Did most of my working years at this company of my family with the main job
of repairing computers, attending clients, developing websites, but in the mean
time developing all my other personal projects.
