Imagina project
---------------
Main developer at a challenging project aimed architecture kiosks and desktops,
to develop a portable 3D presentation of architecture that could handle most mainstream 3D hardware available at the time (like GeForce4).
This project involved producing high quality models and loading into
the application coded in C++, using Ogre 3D engine, handling basic physics with
ODE engine.
The big challenge was to achieve good performance and quality like the best 3D
applications at the time, using my 3D programming skills and also learning new
ones, long before the easy 3D engines like Unity even existed.
Most of all it was fun to work with this talentful team of different skillsets
in design, 3D modeling and animation, and programming.
